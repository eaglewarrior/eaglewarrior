👯 I am highly skilled in Python, Machine learning, deep learning, big data, and cloud technologies also have a strong background in software engineering and web development.

🌱 Currently I am improving my competative coding skills as being datascientist I have to improve my coding skills where competative coding will improve my thinking ability to code more efficiently.
